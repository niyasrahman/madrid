# Madrid

Madrid is the demo app using [Malibu](https://github.com/quintype/malibu) as a starting point.

## toddy-libs

IMPORTANT: This app implements very little functionality in the app itself. The majority of functionality is built into the [toddy-libs](https://github.com/quintype/quintype-toddy-libs) repository.

#### Running with supervisord (local)

```shell
$ brew install supervisord
$ ./run
```

### Working on the service worker

Unfortunately, the service-worker cannot be run with the asset-server. Thus, the service worker is disabled in development mode. To work on the service worker, run

```shell
$ vi app/client/app.js         # remove the check for process.env.NODE_ENV == 'production'
$ vi config/publisher.yml      # remove the asset_host from publisher.yml
$ npm run compile && npm start # restart this if you change the service worker
```
