For more information on how these organisations use information, please read their privacy policies.</p><h2 class="static-container__sub-headline">Use of Cookies</h2><p class="static-container__description"><strong>We use cookies for a number of reasons.</strong></p><ol class="static-container__list"><li>For statistical purposes to track how many users we have and how often they visit our website. We collect information listing which of our pages are most frequently visited, and by which types of users and from which countries.</li><li>We use other organisations to collect anonymous user information, sometimes through cookies and web beacons, (information embedded in images which allow them to analyse how the website is being used and the number of visitors).</li><li>We and other advertisers may use statistical cookies to track who has seen an advert and clicked on it. You can find more information on this in the online behavioural advertising section of this privacy policy.</li><li>Placing cookies on your computer means we can show you adverts that you might be interested in, and allows us to control the number of times you see them and measure how effective the ad campaign has been. Advertising helps us to keep the site free for you to use.</li><li>We may use \'Flash\' cookies to store your preferences for your media player (for example, volume and so on). If we don\'t use them, you may not be able to watch some video content.</li><li>You can turn cookies off but if you do this, you may not be able to use all services on our websites and you might see more pop-ups and other advertising. This is because we won\'t be able to limit what you see by using cookies. However, you will still be able to see our editorial content.</li><li>We or other companies may use cookies to suggest and deliver content which we believe may interest you.</li></ol><p class="static-container__description">By using the sites you are agreeing to the use of cookies as described.</p><p class="static-container__description"><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p><p class="static-container__description">We use Google Analytics on our sites for anonymous reporting of site usage and for advertising on the site.</p><h2 class="static-container__sub-headline">About our advertising</h2><p class="static-container__description">We may use online behavioural advertising (OBA). OBA allows us to deliver targeted advertising to people who visit our website. It works by showing you adverts that are based on your browsing patterns and the way you have interacted with our site. It then shows you adverts which we believe may interest you.</p><p class="static-container__description">As you browse our site, some of the cookies we place on your computer will be advertising cookies, so we can understand what sort of pages you are interested in. We can then display advertising on your browser that is based on these perceived interests. For instance if you have been reading a lot of food and drink articles, you may be shown more adverts for food and drink.</p><p class="static-container__description">It is important to remember that none of the OBA techniques we use will collect information such as your name, email address, postal address or phone number.</p><p class="static-container__description">We may also share anonymised behavioural data with advertising partners, including commercial organisations that fund content labelled \'Supported by\', \'Paid content/Paid for by\' or \'Advertiser content/from our advertisers\'. This may mean that when you are on other websites, you will be shown advertising based on your behaviour on samachara.com. We may also show you advertising on our site based on your behaviour on other sites.</p><p class="static-container__description">Behavioural retargeting is another form of OBA that allows us and some of our advertising partners to show you ads based on your browsing patterns and interactions with a site away from our sites. For example, if you have visited the website of an online clothes shop, you may start seeing ads from that same shopping site displaying special offers or showing you the products that you were browsing. This allows companies to advertise to you if you leave their website without making a purchase.</p><p class="static-container__description">If you want to opt out of receiving online behavioural advertising, this does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising when you are using our sites. It just means that the advertising you see will not be customised for you.</p><p class="static-container__description">Advertising on mobile devices may require the collection and sharing of the unique device ID with companies who purchase advertising space on the mobile application.</p><p class="static-container__description"><strong>Other Advertising</strong></p><p class="static-container__description">Our sites contain links to other websites from which we may earn revenue. Our articles are never influenced by advertisers or affiliates, nor are they written for the purpose of promoting a product, except when clearly branded as a \'sponsored by\', \'brought to you by\' or \'supported by\', \'Paid content/paid for by\' or \'Advertiser content\'/\'from our advertisers\' to represent sponsored content, advertisement features and foundation funded features respectively. </p><p class="static-container__description"><strong>Legal information and how to contact us</strong></p><p class="static-container__description">Under the existed Indian Law we have to say who the \'data controller\' is for <a href="http://samachara.com" class="static-container__link qt-theme__color">samachara.com</a> and services provided through our website.

      aboutUs: `<article class="static-container__wrapper"> <h1 class="static-container__headline">About us</h1> <p class="static-container__description">Samachara.com is an independent digital media making all-out effort to bring unconventionality into journalism in the state of Karnataka. Samachara digs deep into the subject independently to shove uncluttered, unbiased, uninfluenced stories. As is the motto of Samachara\'s journalism is independent, its stories are also absolutely independent.We have Independent of ideological affiliation, political affiliation and corporate affiliation. </p> <p class="static-container__description"> However, Samachara takes a firm stand on issues related to women, children and vulnerable section of society. In Samachara\'s each story, it tries to provide educative and thought provoking angles. </p> <h1 class="static-container__headline">Birth and vision </h1> <p class="static-container__description">Getting stanchly disenchanted with mainstream journalism culture, a young scribe gave a serious thought to build an alternative and unconventional journalism in the state of Karnataka.  Samachara does not have a glittering story to narrate about its birth. The Samachara was started in a single room with one laptop. However, the first story published for the launch of the website was investigative news story. Prior going on air, small-scale promotional activities were carried out in social media, Facebook.</p><p class="static-container__description">A key aim of the Samachara is to spell change in the arena of journalism which is disproportionately market-driven and marred with unethical practices. Samachara feels change can happen only at a right time with the coming together of right minds having genuine ideas.</p><p class="static-container__description">We are presently at a time of frenzied reportage, fabricated information dissimilation and commodification of journalism. The ethics of media is being purchased by vested interests through monetary luring in order to satisfy the apatite of power. The corruption is rooting strongly in the news rooms eventually rotting the entire system of journalism. Samachara envisions setting a new standard for journalism discourse in the digital platform.</p><p class="static-container__description">This online news venture mulls to unravel many untold stories, spread light on sections those are still in dark, investigate media houses, frame right perspectives and bring unconventionality in reportage. Samachara aims to explore new possibilities in reporting styles with the advent of fast developing technology.</p><p class="static-container__description">General public, particularly a large section of television and online news viewers are of the opinion that news media harbour lies. There are many instances of people expressing discontent over anchoring and reporting ways. Samachara will engage such disappointed chunk of people in view of providing alternative journalism and gradually shift those from rent-quote, shouting-match, unhealthy debates, concocted, politically enslaved and jingoistic kind of journalism.</p><p class="static-container__description">Samachara has a concrete action plan and a well thought clarity in its aims and objectives. Samachara will also produce some historic stories those are fresh to Indian journalism. Samachara\'s ideology is ethical and pious journalism.</p></article>`,
